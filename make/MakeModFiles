# The concern of the Makefile is GAMMA defined files used in all Makefiles.   #
# Each module will contribute its own definitions of primary files (source,   #
# header, etc.) which will be dealt with herein with additonal variables used #
# to collect them for the main GAMMA Makefile.                                #
#                                                                             #
# Users are free to copy this file for personal use but may NOT give out      #
# modifications with or without the GAMMA platform.  The GAMMA Basics module  #
# source distrubution is typically packaged with the full GAMMA source        #
# distribution.  The full src distrubution and one for just the Basics module #
# which may be obtained from the GAMMA WWW site above or any of its mirrors.  #
#                                                                             #

# Below are the files that this Makefile deals with.  Any additonal files for #
# source distrubution and/or compilation should be added in this section.     #
# Here are the current definitions:                                           #
#                                                                             #
# FNAMES: "filename" where filename.h & filename.cc are souce code files that #
#         are part of this module.  These will be compiled into the module    #
#         library. DEFINED IN EACH MODULE.                                    #
# BINSUPP:Supplementary files to be included in the binary distrubution.      #
# SUPPF:  Supplementary files to be include in the source distrubution.       #
# CCFILES:The source code files for the module that will compile to .o files  #
# HFILES: The header files (interface) corresponding to the .cc files CCFILES #
# FILES:  These are automatically formed  herein from the base filenames set  #
#         in FNAMES. The are the source interface and implementation files.   #
# OBJ:    These are automatically formed herein from the base filenames set   #
#         in FNAMES. The are the object file names after source compilation.  #
#         Note that unlike the names in FILES, these will contain the full    #
#         GAMMA library path.                                                 #
# OBJP:   Same as OBJ but used when profiling.                                #
# ALLCC:  All .cc source files from this and previous modules                 #
# ALLH:   All header files from this and previous modules                     #
#                                                                             #
# Note that the file defined by FNAMES.h should also be represented in the    #
# module header file called HDRFILE as well as in the RCS control script      #
# RCSSCR. The former will affect how GAMMA generally takes this package       #
# whereas the latter helps to maintain these files (but does not affect GAMMA #
# program directly.)                                                          #
