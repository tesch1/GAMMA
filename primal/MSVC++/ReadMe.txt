                               GAMMA MSVC++ Binaries

                                  Version 4.1.0

This tar distribution contains GAMMA headers and binaries. The package should
produce a working version of GAMMA on any modern Windows based PC, assuming that
the C++ compiler to be used is Microsoft Visual C++ (Version 6 or higher).
Please note that the DLL contained herein will NOT be compatible for use with other
Windows based compilers (e.g. CygWin/GCC, MinGW/GCC, Borland).

The file should be unzipped using any typical Windowsish program to handle such
things. I use WinZip and that is a fine choice.

This should place GAMMA binaries into GAMMAVER\i686-pc-msvc and the GAMMA headers
into GAMMAVER\src. You must select where the folder GAMMAVER will be on your
system. I use C:\gamma\gamma-4.1.0 so that the MSVC++ GAMMA binaries reside in
the folder C:\gamma\gamma-4.1.0\i686-pc-msvc and the GAMMA headers in the folder
C:\gamma\gamma-4.1.0\src. 

The supplied GAMMA binaries are the GAMMA DLL (gamma.dll) and the DLL imports
library (libgamma.dll.a)
