<CENTER><H2>SORRY, THE MAKEFILE IS CURRENTLY BROKEN!</H2></CENTER>
<P>
You are currently in the GAMMA base directory for the release of version 4.1.0.
Although the source codes are quite sound, the Makefile has yet to be completed. 
As a consequence, <STRONG>builds of GAMMA vary from the normal (GNU) steps</STRONG>.
For many cases (Windows, OSX, Linux) one need not build GAMMA from souces, rather
one can just install a pre-built binary. See 
<A HREF="http://gamma.magnet.fsu.edu/download/index.html">GAMMA Downloading</A> at
any GAMMA WWW site.

<P>
If you need to build GAMMA from source codes (there is no binary for your OS/compiler
combination, you have special considerations, you just want to give it a try...)
then you will have to have spend a few minutes following directions on how to do so.

<P>
<CENTER><H3>Builds of GAMMA (Currently) Vary From The Normal Steps</H3></CENTER>

Rather than follow the steps outlined later in this file (left in for when the
Makefile is fixed), please do the following instead...

There is a makefile provided to build GAMMA as a DLL and/or as a static library.
Simply look in the directory <A HREF= "./primal/CygWin/index.html">primal/CygWin</A> 
and follow the instructions provided. In this case one will typically build GAMMA
as a DLL with the -mno-cygwin flag. Note that the DLL has been prebuilt and may
be easily downloaded and installed, .... so you should have good reason to do this

There is a makefile to build GAMMA as a shared object library.
Look in the directory <A HREF= "./primal/Linux/index.html">primal/Linux</A> and follow

<P>
Sorry, you will have to do a bit more work to get GAMMA built. What you must do is
copy the primal Makefile that most closely resembles your OS/Compiler combination and
modify it to work. For example, suppose one were building under IRIX on an SGI.
I would copy the directory primal/Linux to a new directory primal/Irix. Then I would
edit the makefile in the directory primal/Irix to set the directories, compiler flags,
etc to match the demands of IRIX and the compiler to be used.
<P>
If you need help with doing this send some e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:gamma@magnet.fsu.edu"><font color=blue>gamma@magnet.fsu.edu</font></A>.
Often Scott will just log in remotely to your system and do the build for you, in return
he will post the binaries and makefiles so that others can use them.

<P>
The makefile is currently broken so this information is not valid. It will hopefully 
become the means to build GAMMA when the makefile is corrected....
<P>
Those wishing to build GAMMA from sources
on Windows under Visual C++ should use (download) the
<STRONG><A HREF="http://gamma2.magnet.fsu.edu/download/msvc/"><font color="blue">GAMMA MSVC++ Workspace</font></A></STRONG> and follow the associated GAMMA/MSVC++ instructions

    <TD NOWRAP valign="top"><EM><STRONG>./configure</STRONG></EM> Fails&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>If a <EM>permission denied</EM> error is seen then you must set the <EM>configure</EM>
        file to be executable: <EM>chmod a+x configure</EM>, then reissue the configuration
        command, <EM>./configure</EM>.<BR>
        Occasionally configuration failure is caused by residual Windows linefeed characters
        (^M) in the configuration and/or makefiles. Run the command <EM>./DOSNoMore</EM> then
        reissue the configuration command, <EM>./configure</EM>. 
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD NOWRAP valign="top"><EM><STRONG>make</STRONG></EM> Fails&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>Make sure you are using the Gnu make program! GAMMA has complicated Makefiles that
        use commands that some make programs simply do not understand. Type <EM>make -v (or gmake -v)</EM>
        to see what version of Gnu make you are using.
        <BR>
        Make sure that your C/C++ compiler is working. Try and compile some simple C (<EM>file.c</EM>) and
        C++ (<EM>file.cc or file.cpp</EM>) programs. Recent versions of Gnu GCC (>= 2.8.x) usually work just fine
        building GAMMA. With GCC you can use <EM>gcc -v</EM> to see the compiler version you are using.
        <BR>
        If the above are fine, it's probably best to just fill out a 
       <A HREF="http://gamma.magnet.fsu.edu/info/help/index.html"><font color="blue">report of the failure</font></A>.
       Include as much information as you can and send in the specific lines where the compilation failed.
       You might even report any warnings. Although non-fatal, they may indicate some real problem. B
