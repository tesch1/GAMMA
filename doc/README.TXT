The documents in the pdf directory contain valuable 
information on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) with 
a focus on Magnetic Resonance Sprectroscopy (MRS), 
and some useful discussions about the GAMMA C++ code.

They were created by Scott Smith, to whom we owe a
great deal of gratitude - for his work on this library.

The documents have not been kept up to date 
so some of the technical discussions may seem dated, 
but they still serve as a very powerful introduction 
to the GAMMA library.

The complete GAMMA website, as it stood in May of 2011
has been uploaded into the repository "GAMMA_DOCS" and
may be downloaded and viewed from there. The links
have not been updated to point to the local instance;
so keep that in mind if you choose to view them.

The pdf's in this directory are more or less included
in the gamma_docs directory.
