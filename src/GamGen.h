/* The macro _MSC_VER is set by Visual C++ during compilations. It is this
   macro that is mainly used to test for use of MSVC++ and to set up any code
   specifics needed for it. An additional macro was set up by myself, MSVCDLL,
   to handle function declspec decorations needed to build DLLs in windows for
   some systems. This is independent of _MSC_VER, the former is used in all
   MSVC++ compilations whereas the latter is used anytime declspec stuff is
   needed when building DLLs in a Windows environment. Since we minimize the
   amount of declspec usage in GAMMA code, it is ususally only when linking
   to any GAMMA DLL that this is used. DLLs built using Cygwin or MinGW ports
   of GCC to windows do not need the declspec decorations either. Don't know
   about Borland, Intel, and any others.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//                The _declspec Stuff For MSVC++ DLL Builds
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* This variable, MSVCDLL, will be used in GAMMA to handle any __declspec
   declarations required by Microsoft when building DLLs using Visual C++.
   This Microsoftism is to qualify everything (functions, constants, etc) with
   the __declspec(dllexport) when building a DLL and with __declspec(dllimport)
   when using a DLL. Of course, this adds a lot of garbage to the code headers
   which is Microsoft specific. If you are not building a DLL on a Windows
   PC (mainly with MSVC++) then these declspec quailfiers are not required.
   
   GAMMA attempts to avoid trashing its headers with these goofy _declspec
   declarations everywhere. As a consequence, things can be quite painful when
   it comes to DLL building! Here is what is done.

   Microsoft sez that __declspec(dllexport) is not required if the entity one
   is exporting is listed in a .DEF file. The .DEF file is specified when the
   DLL is built & this provides information used in making the static library
   (foo.dll.lib) associated with the DLL (foo.dll).So, instead of making use
   of __declspec(dllexport) in GAMMA, there exists .DEF files that contain all
   of the functions and constants we want exported in GAMMA DLL(s). This is a
   big pain too, because they are partially made by hand. But so be it if we
   can avoid MS code specific additions.

   Use of _declspec(dllimport) is a different story. Although use of a .DEF
   file will completely eliminate the need for _declspec(dllexport), Microsoft
   demands that _declspec(dllimport) be used for static constants. In fact,
   MS recommends that it be used for functions as well, but that is not
   mandatory. To minimize MS specific code, we use _declspec(dllimport) as
   needed on static constants only. The definition of MSVCDLL will handle
   both cases, but is only used in the declaration of all exported contants,
   It is only needed when linking to an MSVC++ built DLL of GAMMA. Hence its
   left empty for the vast majority of GAMMA compilations, including DLLs made
   with Cygwin/GCC, MinGW, and even the PyGAMMA DLL under MSVC++. That is, do
   NOT define USEDLL under any builds except those that are linking to the
   GAMMA DLL under MSVC++. Note that the exporting of these constants for
   MSVC++ is done through use of a .DEF file.                               */

/* There are several problems one might deem as GCC growing pains. These are

 * Consequently, it is nice to know the GCC version number during GAMMA builds
 * so that such version problems can be handled cleanly.  These next lines use
 * the * GCC defined macros __GNUC__, __GNUC_MINOR__, & __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__.

/* One problem is in the std::string.compare function. In GCC 2.9.x it seems
   that the argument order is switched over that in GCC 3.2.x. Other compilers
   (MSVC++, Sun Pro,...) have theirs defined the same as 3.2.x, so I assume
   that it is the standard. I am not sure about 3.0.x and 3.1.x (I hear they
   are bad anyway). The only time I have thus far dealt by 3.1.x is on OSX.2
   and that made for all kinds of troubles, mostly from the way Apple did
   their port.                                                               */

//                GCC Pragma Interface and Implementation Usage
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* Another problem is that there are problems in GAMMA code due to use of
   #pragma interface and #pragma implementation in GCC 3.x.x. Perhaps the GCC
   documentation is out of date on this subject, but if pragmas are used then
   there are multiple "undefined reference" errors when any programs are linked
   to the compiled GAMMA library (or libraries). So, I put an ifdef on all of
   the GNuish pragma (implementation, interface) statments so that they are
   used only if 1.) __GNUG__ is defined and 2.) GAMPRAGMA is defined. Here I
   will set GAMPRAGMA only if we are using GCC version 2.x.x.                */
