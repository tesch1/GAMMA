# The concern of this Makefile, CopyDir, is the making of module file copies  #
# for various GAMMA distributions. These targets handle ONLY files present    #
# in this directory, none others (e.g. binaries, documentation, etc...). The  #
# premise of the targets are quite simple, they copy files from this module   #
# directory to the directory specified in variable COPY2DIR.                  #
#                                                                             #
# Normally these targets are run from amidst distribtion targets contained    #
# either in the module Makefile or in the main GAMMA Makefile.                #
#                                                                             #
# These targets will ALWAYS be run before any GAMMA distributions are done.   #
#                                                                             #
# Users are free to copy this file for personal use but may NOT give out      #
# modifications with or without the GAMMA platform.                           #
#                                                                             #

# MODLABEL:      Cosmetic label for the source module.                        #
# MODULEDIR:     Directory name of the source module.                         #
# MODDISTFILES:  Files in this directory to copy.                             #
# MODSRCFILES:   Source files in this directory to copy.                      #
# MODHDRFILES:   Header files in this directory to copy.                      #
# COPY2DIR:      Directory name where copies will be put                      #
# force:         Required target for use of this makefile                     #

# Note: The Directory COPY2DIR MUST EXIST prior to calling any of these       #
#       targets, except showcopy. The task of producing this directory is     #
#       usually done by whatever target is producing a GAMMA distribution.    #
