# The concern of this Makefile, CleanDir, is the removal of any temporary     #
# that may exist in this directory. During the course of GAMMA developement   #
# spurious files can be left behind that clutter up the directory. They have  #
# little to do with GAMMA and should be removed, especially if backups of the #
# platform (all files, all directories) are to be performed. This can vastly  #
# reduce the disk space needed to contain GAMMA. The target can be run on a   #
# regular basis.                                                              #

# These targets use standard Unix functionality: rm. This is as is suggested  #
# by GNU standards                                                            #
