Version 4.3.1 - 29 August 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main feature of this release is the new pulseshift() function added
to PulAuxil. It's available to both GAMMA and PyGAMMA.

Additionally -- 

- In GenOp, completed SWIG-ing the functions of type /=, +=, etc. (so they 
return a "gen_op &"). This allows these functions to be accessed from PyGAMMA.

- Added real() and imag() functions to the GAMMA (PyGAMMA) class "complex"
to allow retrieval of the internal components from Python.



Version 4.3.0 - 5 July 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release features an expanded PyGAMMA which exposes most of GAMMA 
via Python. A full list of enhancements is below. Special thanks go to 
Matthias Ernst for all of his help with this release.

- Most of GAMMA is now available via Python. For a full list of what is and 
isn't available, see here:

- BLAS/LAPACK integration is automatically enabled under OS X and Solaris and 
it's easy to enable for some Linuxes. See here for more information:

- We fixed a number of Makefile problems and made the Makefiles easier to 
maintain.

- We fixed the gamma script (on all platforms) for those of you that like to 
write and compile your own C++ GAMMA code.

- We cleaned all references to Boost (the old, unused Python interface) from 
the Makefiles and code.



Version 4.2.2 - 11 May 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release fixes the broken 32 bit Python 2.6 and 2.7 libraries for OS X
that were distributed with PyGAMMA 4.2.1.

It contains no other changes.



Version 4.2.1 - 10 May 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version is a small update to PyGAMMA's installation routine and prebuilt
libraries. It contains no functional changes to GAMMA or PyGAMMA.

- We changed the PyGAMMA ZIP file to not contain an empty directory which
some unzippers can't handle.

- We added prebuilt PyGAMMA binaries for Python 2.7 on OS X, Linux and 
Windows.



Version 4.2.0 - 10 Nov 2010
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first version of GAMMA to be released from the UCSF/Duke
collaboration.
