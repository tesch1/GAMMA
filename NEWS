This release fixes the broken 32 bit Python 2.6 and 2.7 libraries for OS X
that were distributed with PyGAMMA 4.2.1.

It contains no other changes.



Version 4.2.1 - 10 May 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version is a small update to PyGAMMA's installation routine and prebuilt
libraries. It contains no functional changes to GAMMA or PyGAMMA.

- We changed the PyGAMMA ZIP file to not contain an empty directory which
some unzippers can't handle.

- We added prebuilt PyGAMMA binaries for Python 2.7 on OS X, Linux and 
Windows.



Version 4.2.0 - 10 Nov 2010
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first version of GAMMA to be released from the UCSF/Duke
collaboration.
