This build probably worked at some point and might still work for all
we know.  However, we haven't tested it and we aren't maintaining it. 
We're passing along what we inherited in case someone wants to get it 
working again. 

Note, this directory was moved from the gamma/trunk/ directory to the 
gamma/trunk/platfoms directory, so some changes will be required in 
the project in order for it to find the source code.
